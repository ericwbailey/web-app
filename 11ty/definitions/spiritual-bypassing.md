a behavior that uses spiritual ideas and practices to delay or ignore acknowledging hardship; the pursuit of “good vibes only” or “oneness” that can downplay difficulties brought up by others, especially from [minoritized](/definitions/minoritised/) groups; present in many Western wellness and self-help practices, primarily Yoga

## Issues

Spiritual bypassing avoids deeply addressing discomfort by offering surface-level platitudes, often in the form of co-opted religious, philosophical, and spiritual practices and terminology.

Not addressing discomfort means an individual will not process and internalize difficult or painful events. Escapism of this form prevents the individual from working through discomfort and hardship. Such a spiritual bypassing approach is directly at odds with Yoga’s practice of being present and working through emotional discomfort.

Failing to acknowledge hardship is especially problematic in the context of minoritized groups in wellness spaces. Downplaying both invalidates their lived experiences and creates an environment that both disincentives further participation and suppresses trauma.

Wellness instructors often perpetuate spiritual bypassing by modeling the behavior they see from others practitioners, notably on social media. Oftentimes they are unaware of its negative aspects and view the behavior as a deeper investment in the practice.

Furthermore, co-opted language and imagery is often drawn specifically from Indian culture and Hindu faith. Concepts are often presented by people who do not identify as Indian or of Hindu faith and without attribution to and context of or in conflict with the original cultural context.

## Examples

An instructor saying a phrase such as, “we are all one” or “we are all human” when confronted with difficulty or hardship.

## What to do instead

The first step is to recognize when spiritual bypassing as a discrete behavior that takes place both in-person and on social media channels. With this understanding, you are able to identify and call out its behavior.

Also understand the chilling effects it has on minoritized communities, and how it affects their presence (or lack of presence) in these spaces.
